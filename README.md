# Stock_Trend_Tracker
This application has been created to provide the user with detailed information about stock histories, 
as well as provide possible predictions for any given stock using Brownian Motion and the Monte Carlo
Method. 
KEEP IN MIND: THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE REAL TIME DATA!
It can provide stock prices for most tickers on most stock exchanges, and further development may be done to 
strengthen out the financial analysis of the stocks. One of the few steps underway is to account for the Beta Sharpe 
ratio for the stock in comparison to market prices to find risk adjusted returns to better predict prices.
